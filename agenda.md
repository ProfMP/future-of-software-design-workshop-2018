To kick off the workshop, everyone will share a [5 minute (or less!) lightning talks](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/future-of-software-design-workshop-2017/blob/master/participation.md#lighting-talks).  During the lighting talks you introduce yourself and share your thoughts on the future of software design.  See the [list of thinking questions](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/future-of-software-design-workshop-2017/blob/master/participation.md#ideas-for-your-lightning-talk) for ideas and guidance.

Note takers: all participants

Goal: Break the ice, help participants get to know one another, put a bunch of ideas into the open.

Outcomes: Please share your slides or a brief write-up on this website by [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Hints and tips:
* Plan to take notes during the lightning talks so you're prepared for the next sessions.
* Flip charts and projectors will be available.
* Please share your notes with the group via the email list.  Depending on how "raw" the notes are they might be cleaned
  up, and posted together on this website.

### 11:00-11:15 Break

Snacks and coffee provided.


### 11:15-12:30 Discussion themes, expected outcomes

During the second morning session we'll continue to iterate on ideas raised during the Lightning Talks on our way to deciding how to spend our time for the rest of the day.

* What we have heard?
* What we would like to focus on?
* What are common themes?
* What we would like to get out of the discussions?

Note takers: 

Goal: Create a more detailed agenda for the afternoon sessions.

Outcomes: Raw notes posted to the website, detailed agenda


### 12:30-13:30 Lunch

Lunch provided.


### 13:30 - 15:00 Small group discussions

In the afternoon we'll self-organize into at most four small groups (3 - 10 people max) to discuss
the topics we discovered during the morning sessions.  The idea is to deeply discuss the topic,
digging for “ahha!” kinds of moments but also uncovering those nuanced understandings of the world
that help us discover interesting and important ideas.

The small groups will work together for the whole time on the same topic.  Follow the thread wherever
it takes you.  If new actions emerge, start working on those.  Use whatever brainstorming and synthesis
techniques you think are going to help you get interesting and useful information out of the session.

Goal: Make parallel progress on themes, go deep (or broad) into interesting topic areas, come up with
action items if applicable, start working on action items if it makes sense

Outcomes: Each group will have an opportunity to share their discussion outcomes with the rest of the
group

Hints and Tips:

* Use the “law of two feet” to find a group where you can stay engaged and contribute.
* Assign someone to take notes
* Do not shy away from exploring topics that emerge in the discussion, just be ready to share them with the rest



### 15:00-15:30 Break

Snacks and coffee provided

### 15:30 - 17:00 Small group discussions (continued)

The second afternoon session will follow the same format as the first afternoon session.  We can
remix the groups and pick new topics if people want to do so.


### 17:00 - 17:30 Preliminary reports from groups

Before we break for the day we'll share some of the things we discovered during the
group discussions.

What are we learning: challenges, fruitful directions, out of the box ideas
